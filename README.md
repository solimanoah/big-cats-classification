# big-cats-classification

## Project Overview

For a complete overview of the project, see [BIG_CATS_CLASSIFICATION_README.pdf](./BIG_CATS_CLASSIFICATION_README.pdf).

## How to Run

The complete training and evaluation process is implemented in the Colab notebook: [big_cats_classification.ipynb](./notebooks/big_cats_classification.ipynb).

To reproduce results:
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Update any Drive paths in the early code cells if your setup differs.
3. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.
